Hi all. This is my first attempt at the build from the "OOP php Object-Oriented Programming" course, by Edwin Diaz on Udemy (see link below).

The course guides you through a website build from a basic CMS template (not MVC) where you will learn:

- How to create public and private web pages
- How to create a login feature
- How to interact with the MySQL database
- Functionality to add, edit and delete (with confirmation) individual records
- List many records
- Pass parameters through the URL
- Much more

The course lasts ~20 hours. You will learn PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, HTML.
