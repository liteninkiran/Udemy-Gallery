Hi all. This is my first attempt at the build from the "OOP php Object-Oriented Programming" course, by Edwin Diaz on Udemy (see link below).

The course guides you through a website build from a basic CMS template (not MVC) where you will create public web pages, a login feature, how to interact with the MySQL database, functionality to add, delete (with confirmation) and edit individual records, list many records, passing parameters through the URL and much more.
